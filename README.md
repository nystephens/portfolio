Professional Coding Portfolio

This is the homepage for my coding portfolio.  It includes a photo of me, a breif description of my background, some links to deployed projects, and my relevant contact info.  There is a header with links to the main sections. The web layout has been styled to fit to scale with different veiwport sizes using both flexbox and media queries.  

Here is a screenshot of the deployed webpage:
